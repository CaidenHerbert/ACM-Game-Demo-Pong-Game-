# ACM-Game-Demo-Pong-Game - Our collaborative project involved creating the classic game Pong using C#. Each team member took responsibility for different aspects of the game. We combined our individual parts to deliver a cohesive and polished final product. My contributions are in the ball.cs, score.cs, and gamemanager.cs sections of the code.
